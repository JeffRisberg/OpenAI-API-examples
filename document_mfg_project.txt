We need to build a system which will provide automatic tracking of manufacturing problems.

There are about 5,000 parts in our inventory.

Our factory builds advanced bicycles.

cost control is an important issue, because some parts are quite expensive.

The types of bikes are Virgina-class, Seawolf-class, and Columbia-class.

The pieces of a bike are:
* frame
* tires
* handlebars
* front gear
* back gear
* seat
* light
* back reflector


We would like to keep track of the inventory of each part, each day.

when new parts arrive, we must update the inventory

IF a part fails during assembly we will create a part manufactoring failure report.
The report will contain information about the part and the step of manufacturing when it failed.

I have working locations in Easthampton and Westhampton.

we can look up the prices of parts from a database.

the steps associated with building a bike are:
* form the frame
* attach the tires
* attach the back gear
* attach the front gear
* attach the handlebars
* attach the seat
* fasten the light onto the front
* fasten the reflector onto the back.
* ride the bike around the factory once.

If any step fails, then skip counting all of hte steps afterwards.

Here is a dump of the part table. Part number is a five digit code, the vendor code is a four-digit code.

During assembly, we will measure what the frame's stress level is, and if the stress level is less than 30 pounds, it is considered
to have failed.

When we attach the handlebars, if it fails, we will try to grind down the edges and try again.

The input screens should validate all part information against the part table.
